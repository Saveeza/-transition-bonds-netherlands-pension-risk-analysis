### üìÅ Description: Data Folder

This folder contains the final structured datasets used for the quantitative analysis and visualizations presented in the accompanying research article.

The raw data originated from over 1,000 pages of public disclosures, including Dutch pension fund annual reports, SFDR templates, green/transition bond registers, and EU Taxonomy-related KPIs. These were processed using Python and Excel to extract, clean, and standardize information across funds and years.

Due to the volume and complexity of the source material, this folder includes only the **key findings and computed indicators**‚Äîthe distilled version used for visualizations and risk assessment. These include:

- **Bond-level alignment scores** based on weighted EU Taxonomy criteria  
- **KPI verification breakdowns** (verified vs. self-reported)  
- **Sectoral exposure estimates** (EUR millions at risk)  
- **Portfolio-level holdings summaries** across ABP, PFZW, PME, and PMT  
- **Scoring model reference** used to classify bonds as aligned, partially aligned, or non-aligned

This data underpins all charts, tables, and calculations referenced in the article.
