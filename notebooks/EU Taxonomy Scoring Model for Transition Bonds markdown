# üìä EU Taxonomy Scoring Model for Transition Bonds

## Objective
To assess the EU Taxonomy alignment of transition bonds held by major Dutch pension funds (ABP, PFZW, PME, PMT) using a custom-built scoring framework.

## Overview
This notebook cleans, classifies, and scores bond-level sustainability data extracted from public pension fund disclosures and SFDR templates. It applies alignment thresholds and scoring logic based on key EU Taxonomy metrics.

## Tools & Methods
- Python (pandas, numpy, tabula-py)
- Excel-based manual verification
- Custom scoring rules for alignment level: Fully, Partially, Non-Aligned
- Output used in visualizations and fund-level comparisons

‚û°Ô∏è Outputs: Alignment table, scoring summary, feed-in data for heatmaps and stranded asset estimates.
