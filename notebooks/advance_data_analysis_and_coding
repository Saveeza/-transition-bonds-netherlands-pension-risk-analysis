üìÅ Notebooks
This folder contains all the main analysis files used in the project on Dutch pension funds and transition bond credibility. The notebooks include the data models, scoring methods, and risk analysis used to assess EU Taxonomy alignment, KPI disclosure quality, and stranded asset exposure.

These files are built from real reports, SFDR templates, and sustainability disclosures published by Dutch pension funds between 2020 and 2023.
