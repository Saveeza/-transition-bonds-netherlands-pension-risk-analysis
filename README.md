## 📘 Overview

This repository supports the article:  
**[Dutch Pension Funds’ Bet on Transition Bonds: Data Shows a Credibility Gap?](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/dutch-pension-funds-credibility-challenge-transition-bonds-chaudhry--g2jje)**

We conducted a multi-stage data-driven audit of transition bonds held by four major Dutch pension funds (ABP, PFZW, PME, and PMT). Using over 1,000 pages of disclosures, we extracted and scored bond-level alignment with the EU Taxonomy, verified KPI disclosures, and modeled exposure to stranded asset risk under different climate scenarios.

---

## 🔍 Key Findings

- ✅ **Only 37% of bond proceeds** were fully aligned with EU Taxonomy thresholds
- ❌ **60% of reported KPIs** lacked third-party assurance or science-based benchmarks
- ⚠️ Up to **€2.1 billion at risk** of being stranded under revised EU climate rules
- 📉 PME and PMT had the lowest average bond credibility scores
- 🔄 Misclassification found between SFDR Article 9 and actual environmental performance

## 🧠 Technical Framework

### 🛠 Tools Used
- Python (tabula-py, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Excel (pivot tables, formula-based scoring, cross-validation)
- Jupyter Notebooks (for scoring logic, scenario modeling, visual generation)
- Binder (for public, reproducible access)

### 🧪 Analysis Performed
- Manual extraction of bond disclosures from SFDR templates and reports (2020–2023)
- Scoring model for EU taxonomy alignment
- KPI audit and classification (verified vs internal benchmarks)
- Sectoral heatmapping of climate risk exposure
- Scenario simulation for potential stranded asset losses
- Portfolio-level inconsistencies flagged between stated SFDR classification and real-world impact

## 🚧 Barriers, Risks, and Misconduct Potential

- ⚠️ Inconsistent disclosure formats across funds
- 🧾 Lack of mandatory KPI verification
- 🔐 Internal KPI creation without third-party assurance
- 📉 Misuse of SFDR Article 9 classification
- 🔍 Insufficient sectoral stress testing for high-risk investments

---

## 🧭 Policy Implications and Strategic Recommendations

| Recommendation | Impact |
|----------------|--------|
| ✅ Mandatory third-party KPI audits | Improves ESG disclosure credibility |
| ✅ Clarify Taxonomy-SFDR alignment thresholds | Minimizes greenwashing loopholes |
| ✅ Fund-level scenario stress testing | Identifies sectoral risk concentrations |
| ✅ Interactive ESG dashboards | Enhances transparency for regulators & stakeholders |
| ✅ Enforcement against mislabeling | Reduces credibility risk in transition bond markets |

---

## 📢 Call to Action

🔎 **For Dutch and EU financial policymakers, pension analysts, and ESG strategists:**

- Assess your SFDR Article 9 allocations using real taxonomy data
- Audit internal KPIs for climate science alignment and assurance
- Adopt multi-variable scoring systems to validate fund-level alignment
- Use heatmaps and simulations to prepare for upcoming policy tightening
